# Minesweeper Game

## Overview

This project is a classic Minesweeper game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is designed to be responsive and supports both light and dark themes.

## Features

*   **Classic Minesweeper Gameplay:** The core mechanics of the game are implemented, including revealing cells, flagging mines, and a win/loss condition.
*   **Responsive Design:** The game board and controls adapt to different screen sizes, making it playable on both desktop and mobile devices.
*   **Theme Switching:** Users can switch between light and dark themes for a comfortable viewing experience.
*   **Game Controls:** The game includes controls for resetting the game and selecting different difficulty levels.

## Project Structure

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the game.
*   `style.css`: The CSS file that contains the styles for the game, including the light and dark themes.
*   `main.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the game logic and creates the game board as a Web Component.

## Current Plan

1.  **Create the basic HTML structure:** Set up the game container, header, controls, and a placeholder for the game board in `index.html`.
2.  **Style the game:** Add CSS to `style.css` to style the game board, cells, controls, and implement the light and dark themes.
3.  **Implement the game logic:** In `main.js`, create a Web Component for the Minesweeper game that handles board generation, user interaction, and game state management.
